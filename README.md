# Eshop (Tutorial)

## Reflection 1
I think my code is sufficiently clean and secure. For clean code practices, I used descriptive names for variables and method/functions. And also I structure my code so that it is self-documenting.
For secore code practices, I implemented the product ID using UUID so that it cannot be enumerated. 
Also when editing a product, I forced the product given to the method to use the old UUID to prevent duplicate ID's.
I need to improve my commit messages, since some of them are not very descriptive or informative.

## Reflection 2
1. I feel like I am still very bad at writing tests.
   How many unit tests in a class depends on how many features it has.
   100% coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code, since the tests can also be buggy.

2. The new test could be repetitive since the new tests is doing similar things. We can refactor the new functional suites to include the prior setups and instance variables.
